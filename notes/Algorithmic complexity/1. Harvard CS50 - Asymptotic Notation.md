1. Asymptotic Complexity is a standardised and scientific way to measure the time complexity of an algorithm.
2. As an example, if I want to find the length of a string, we have two options
a. We can use a loop to iterate through the string and count the number of characters. With this approach as the length of the string increases, the  time increases (or number of steps) linearly. 
"abcd" will take 4 steps to complete. "abcde" will take 5 steps.
b. We can save the length of the string in a variable and then use that variable to count the number of characters. With this approach as the length of the string increases, the time (or number of steps) remains constant.
3. If an algorithm takes O(n^2) complexity, it does not mean that it will always be slower than an algorithm with O(n) complexity. It simply means that as the size of the input increases, the algorithm will take longer to complete.
