1. O(1) takes the same amount of time to execute regardless of the amount of input.
2. O(N) grows linearly with the size of input array. Example - Linear Search of the array. 
3. O(N^2) - Bubble Sort. O(N^x) usually happens in algorithms with nested loops. 
4. O(log N) - Binary Search. O(log N) usually happens in algorithms where the algorithm reduces the size in half during execution.
5. O( N Log N) - Quicksort
